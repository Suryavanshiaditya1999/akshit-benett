### BIOS

- Basic Input Output System
- Performs POST(Power on Self Test) : Checks if all the hardware components are running in proper condition . If something is wrong it shows an error on screen . e.g : keyboard , screen , mouse etc
- Apart from BIOS , UEFI is also used

### MBR

- Master Boot Record
- It's size is 512 byte in it the size is divided as follows

- Primary function of the MBR is to locate the bootloader program (like GRUB) on the disk and pass control to it.
- Partition table in the MBR (Master Boot Record) is crucial for organizing and managing the storage on a disk. It provides a map of how the disk's space is allocated and where different partitions (sections) of the disk begin and end.

### GRUB

- Grand Unified Boot Loader
- It uses  /boot/grub2/grub.cfg to determine how to boot the operating system .
- It is capable of reading filesystems, so it can locate and read the grub.cfg file.
- GRUB reads and parses grub.cfg to build the boot menu. This file contains directives and commands that tell GRUB how to load the kernel and initial ramdisk (initrd/initramfs), set kernel parameters, and configure the boot options.
- At this stage user will see the GUI asking different OS or kernels configured to boot .

### Kernel

- Once the kernel and initrd/initramfs are loaded into memory, GRUB passes control to the kernel. At this point, GRUBâ€™s job is essentially done, and the kernel takes over.
- When the kernel starts, it detects the initrd or initramfs that was loaded into memory by GRUB. It then unpacks initramfs into a temporary filesystem in memory or mounts initrd as a temporary block device.

- Basically Kernel mounts root file system and starts initial process usually `init` or `systemd` . `init` was in previous versions now there is `systemd`

### Systemd

- In earlier versions of ubuntu there was run-levels but now there is targets
- To see different targets `cd /usr/lib/systemd/system` `ls -l runlevel*`
- To see the current target in which our system is running `systemctl get-default`
