AWS ALB Use Cases
Based on the provided search results, here are some AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) use cases:

Microservices Architecture: ALB is particularly useful for websites and mobile apps running in containers or on AWS EC2 instances within a microservices architecture. It can be used as an internal load balancer in front of EC2 instances or Docker containers implementing a particular service.

Customizable Sticky Sessions: ALB uses its own cookies, whereas ELB allows application-defined sticky session cookies. This makes ELB a better choice when you need fine-grained control over sticky sessions.

Legacy Workloads: ELB is the only load balancer that works in EC2-Classic, making it a suitable choice for legacy workloads still running on this infrastructure.

Real-time Data Streaming: NLBs are better suited for near real-time data streaming services (e.g., video, stock quotes) that require low latency and high throughput.

Non-HTTP Protocols: NLBs are also a good choice when your application uses non-HTTP protocols.

Scalability and High Availability: ALB scales automatically, and AWS ensures that underlying resources are adjusted to demand. This makes it suitable for applications requiring high availability and scalability.

Centralized Endpoint: ALB can be used to create a centralized endpoint for multiple services, making it easier to manage and monitor traffic.

Cascading Load Balancers: You can cascade multiple Load Balancers, one after another, to create a more complex routing setup (e.g., a Load Balancer in a private subnet connecting a highly available application and cannot be reached from outside).

Monitoring and Logging: ALB provides fine-grained monitoring and logging capabilities, allowing for faster countermeasures in case of attacks.

Integration with AWS Services: ALB integrates well with other AWS services, such as Web Application Firewall (WAF) and AWS Shield, to provide enhanced security and defense against DDoS attacks.

Containerized Applications: ALB is suitable for containerized applications, as it can handle traffic routing and load balancing for multiple containers and services.

Complex Web Applications: ALB is particularly useful for complex web applications that require traffic routing and load balancing based on specific components or services.

These use cases highlight the versatility of AWS ALB and its ability to handle a wide range of scenarios, from simple load balancing to complex traffic routing and security requirements.
