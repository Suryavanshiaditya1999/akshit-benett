AWS offers two types of load balancers that cater to different needs: Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB). Here's a breakdown of the differences between them:

1. Layer of Operation.
ALB (Application Load Balancer): Operates at Layer 7 of the OSI model (Application Layer). It is designed to handle HTTP/HTTPS requests and routes traffic based on content, such as URLs, host headers, and more.
NLB (Network Load Balancer): Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer). It routes TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic based on IP protocol data without looking at the content of the request.
2. Use Case.
ALB: Best suited for HTTP/HTTPS applications and services that require advanced routing, SSL termination, and stickiness based on cookies.
NLB: Ideal for low-latency TCP/UDP applications, such as gaming servers, real-time communications, or IoT services, where speed and performance are critical.
3. Traffic Routing.
ALB: Supports content-based routing (e.g., URL path-based routing, host-based routing). You can route traffic to different targets based on the request URL, domain, etc.
NLB: Performs direct IP-based routing. It forwards the request to the target group based on IP addresses, without inspecting the content of the traffic.
4. TLS/SSL Termination.
ALB: Supports SSL/TLS termination, allowing you to offload SSL decryption to the ALB and manage certificates using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
NLB: Supports SSL passthrough, meaning it forwards encrypted traffic to the targets. SSL termination is handled at the target itself.
5. Health Checks.
ALB: Performs health checks at the application layer, meaning it checks if your application (HTTP/HTTPS endpoint) is responding correctly.
NLB: Conducts health checks at the network layer, verifying whether the server is reachable at the TCP/UDP layer.
6. Performance and Latency.
ALB: Slightly higher latency compared to NLB, as it operates at Layer 7 and performs more complex routing and inspection.
NLB: Offers extremely low latency and can handle millions of requests per second, making it suitable for high-performance applications.
7. Protocol Support.
ALB: Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket.
NLB: Supports TCP, UDP, and TLS (with SSL passthrough).
8. Sticky Sessions.
ALB: Provides support for sticky sessions based on application cookies.
NLB: Does not support sticky sessions.
9. Pricing.
ALB: Generally, it has a cost model based on the number of new connections and the amount of data processed.
NLB: Pricing is typically based on the number of new connections, active flows, and the data processed. NLB is usually more expensive per request but offers better performance for high-traffic or low-latency needs.
10. Logging.
ALB: Provides access logs that include detailed information about requests (like URL, source IP, etc.).
NLB: Provides flow logs, which capture more limited information about the traffic (such as source IP, destination IP, protocol, etc.).
Summary:
ALB: Ideal for advanced routing, HTTP/HTTPS traffic, and applications that need Layer 7 features like SSL termination and URL-based routing.
NLB: Suitable for extreme performance and low-latency use cases, TCP/UDP applications, and when Layer 4 traffic routing is enough.
Choosing between ALB and NLB depends on the specific requirements of your application and the kind of traffic you need to manage.
host-based routing). You can route traffic to different targets based on the request URL, domain, etc.
NLB: Performs direct IP-based routing. It forwards the request to the target group based on IP addresses, without inspecting the content of the traffic.
