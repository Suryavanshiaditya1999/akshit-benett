AWS NLB Use Cases
Based on the provided search results, here are some AWS NLB (Network Load Balancer) use cases:

Server-to-Server Communication: NLB can be used to load balance traffic between multiple servers, such as database replicas, without requiring the application to be aware of the underlying infrastructure. This allows for scalability and high availability without modifying the application code.
Non-HTTP Protocols: NLB operates at Layer 4 (OSI model) and can handle non-HTTP protocols, such as RDP, SSH, and others. This makes it suitable for load balancing applications that use these protocols.
Hybrid Cloud Environments: NLB can be used to load balance applications across a hybrid cloud, connecting on-premises data centers with AWS VPCs. This enables seamless communication between applications deployed across both environments.
High-Throughput and Low-Latency Applications: NLB’s ability to handle large volumes of traffic and its low latency make it suitable for applications that require high throughput and fast response times, such as real-time data streaming services.
DDoS Protection: NLB’s offloading function can help defend against DDoS attacks by shifting malicious traffic away from target servers, reducing the burden on the application and improving overall security.
IP Hash Load Balancing: NLB can use IP Hash as a load balancing algorithm, which determines the server to receive a request based on the client’s IP address. This is useful in scenarios where sticky sessions are not required.
Load Balancing for Non-Web Applications: NLB can be used to load balance applications that don’t rely on HTTP traffic, such as file servers, database servers, or other network-based services.
Some scenarios where NLB might be preferred over ALB (Application Load Balancer) include:

When the application doesn’t require advanced features like path-based routing, cookie-based session stickiness, or HTTP headers.
When the application uses non-HTTP protocols or requires low-level network control.
When high availability and scalability are critical, but the application doesn’t require advanced load balancing features.
Keep in mind that these use cases are based on the search results provided and might not be exhaustive. It’s essential to evaluate your specific requirements and consider factors like protocol, performance, and security when choosing between NLB and ALB.
