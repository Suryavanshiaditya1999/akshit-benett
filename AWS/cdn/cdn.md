You have one main server which holds the website and then multiple edge location servers which holds the cached data of the website for the end user

- when a user is requesting website for the first does the request goes to main server or only edge location server

- lets say two people from same location has requested a website earlier , now a third person from same location request the same website , how does cdn works in this case
