## Q. How to check status of your commits ??

- file1 and file2 are added using `git add` command but `file3` is not added to staging area that's why it is showing *untracked*

## Q. What is the difference between fetch and pull

## Q. Difference between merge and rebase ? When to use which ? What you were using in your organization ?

## Q. `PR` ky hoti hai aur ku use hoti hai ??

`PR` : yaani pull request use hoti hai jab koi insan kisi ek branch par kaam kr rha hota hai aur use apna kaam manlo main branch par merge krvana ho , Esa ku jaruri hai kuki senior dev jo hoga vo obviosuly check krna chahega ki code m ky changes krein hain before merging it to main branch

- Man lo agar tum `my-branch` par kuch commit krte ho apna kuch bhi , to agar `UI` par dekhoge to `main` branch par tumhe `Compare and Pull Request` kr k aayega , isko tum kuch comment dal k merge kr skte ho main branch par
